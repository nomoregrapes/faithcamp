faithcamp
======
A handy (unofficial) web app for Faith Camp event. The app is [available online](http://www.livingwithdragons.com/maps/faithcamp/) and you can use the short URL [bit.ly/faithcamp](http://bit.ly/faithcamp).

2015 will be my first year at [Faith Camp](http://www.kingdomfaith.com/FaithCamp/default.aspx) and so I've copied my [Unofficial Newday App](https://github.com/nomoregrapes/newday) to use it for Faith Camp.

## Notes for users ##
This year the app is only available as a mobile website. **It may not be that useful for you.** The app is unofficial and no warranty is given.

## Notes for developers ##
If you're not familiar with HTML, CSS, and ideally Javascript, then this section won't mean much to you. Why are you even reading the readme? My code is not labelled with a license, technically/legally you should not use or adapt this code without my explicit permission. I give no warranty to what it may or may not do.
* server - contains files to run on the server. I'm trying to avoid this is as it makes an internet connection more required.
* web - is the website-based app files.

## Data ##
The app primarily uses information contained within the [event site map](http://www.kingdomfaith.com/images/faith_camp/layout/site_map.gif)
